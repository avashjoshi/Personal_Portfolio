				<div class="entry">
					<p>Over the last 2 to 3 decades,<strong> Technology </strong> has become more and more a part of our daily lives, to the point where it has taken over our lives. 
					Take a moment, stop reading this post and look around you. What do you notice? Do you see tech, gadgets, computers, video monitoring? It has impacted people, businesses and society as a whole. 
					The roles that technology has played on communication, business and education have been more than impactful. 
					 </p>
					<p>With each passing day, technology is growing by leaps and bounds. And despite concerns about unemployment and over-dependence, proper use of technology holds a bright future for us. 
					Technology and human life cannot be separated; society has a cyclical co-dependence on technology. We use technology; depend on technology in our daily life and our needs and demands for technology keep on rising. 
					Humans use technology to travel, to communicate, to learn, to do business and to live in comfort. 
					It is like impossible to understand and research on how each new advanced technology has impacted our lives and how it will impact our coming generations. 
					<br>As the power of computers continue to increase with help from databases, social networking and businesses, it adds an increase to office productivity compared to using typewriters, and filing cabinets. Although there are plenty of good things about technology, 
					the way we use it determines if it impacts are positive or negative. </p></div>

				<h2>CHANGES BROUGHT BY TECHNOLOGY</h2>
				<p> Technological changes are 
		often accompanied by social, political, and economic changes that can be beneficial or 
		detrimental to individuals and to society. </p>
		<p><strong>Positive effects</strong> of technology
Technology plays a role in virtually every part of our lives, whether we’re aware of it or not. 
Technology may positively affect our physical and mental health by:
health apps to track chronic illnesses and communicate vital information to doctors,
online medical records that give you access to test results and allow you to fill prescriptions,
online education and ease of research,
enhanced communication with others, which can improve the feeling of connection. <br><strong>Negative Changes:</strong>
		<span id="remainingText">
		We only have one life and the day lasts only twenty-four hours, so we must use time wisely. 
		Unfortunately, many of use spend hours and hours looking at mobiles, tablets and laptops, doing nothing clever. The excessive use of modern technology reduces our concentration, productivity and affects our way of thinking. After spending a few years on the Internet, 
		we find it hard to sit down and indulge in reading a book. </span></p>
